  In this research, we present an attempt to improve the detection capability of YOLOv7 for airborne objects. 
  Airborne objects appear considerably small in camera images when they are located at a considerable distance from the camera. 
  However, due to their high speed of movement, it is crucial to detect them while they are still far away. 
  Therefore, to effectively detect these objects, YOLOv7 needs to be optimized for small objects.
  To address this challenge, we proposed several modifications that include changes in the architecture (adding an extra detection head, modifying the feature-map source, and replacing the detection head with a detached anchor-free head), application of bag-of-freebies techniques (anchor recalculation and mosaic augmentation), and change in the inference process (partitioning the image and performing inference on each partition).
  Through comprehensive experimentation, we have discovered that the combination of replacing the detection head with a detached anchor-free head, and performing inference on partitions yields the most promising results, with a significant increase in mean average precision (mAP) of 46.18\% while still maintaining real-time inference speed (greater than 10 FPS).
  This improvement is notably higher compared to the unmodified plain YOLOv7, which achieved an mAP score of 0\%.
